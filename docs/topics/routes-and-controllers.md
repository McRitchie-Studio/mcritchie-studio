# Routes & Controllers

> **When to read this:** Adding a route, writing a new controller, debugging a write-action error log, or understanding the URL surface.

Hover to enlarge image (1.6× → 2.8× scale, with name label below) and swap `src` from 100w to 400w cached variant. Team header links to `/teams/:slug/depth-chart`. Eager-loads `image_caches` via `Roster#pick_starters`. Coaches load via `@coaches_by_team` preload (no headshots → initials circle). Each team header has 3 action buttons: **🆚 Week 1** (links to that team's week-1 game on `/games/:year/week/1/:slug`), **👀 Preview** (opens lineup graphic page in new tab), **🐦 New X Post** (creates a Starter Post X Content draft).

Drag-handle reorders depth within a position via SortableJS; lock toggle (🔓/🔒) per entry — locked rows are skipped by seed re-rank and ESPN scraper. JS in `app/javascript/depth_chart.js` (importmap-pinned). Endpoints: `POST /teams/:slug/depth-chart/reorder` and `POST /depth_chart_entries/:id/toggle_lock`.

- `/usages` — Usage table
- `/toast_test` — Toast notification test page (all variants, server-side flash test)
- `/admin/ai_builder_multiple` — Admin JSON endpoint for latest AI Builder Multiple index weeks and the latest builder weekly commit pace metrics. Includes a caveat that this is public GitHub builder activity, not a true productivity measure.
- `/admin/theme` — Theme editor + styleguide (engine-provided: color editor, logos, tokens, typography, buttons, components)
- `/error_logs` — Error log index (search with ILIKE, Esc to clear, 500ms loading animation)
- `/error_logs/:slug` — Error log detail (backtrace, target/parent with copy-to-clipboard console commands, JSON)

## New Controller Checklist

1. Identify write actions (create, update, destroy, state transitions)
2. Wrap each with `rescue_and_log(target:, parent:)` + bang methods inside
3. Add outer `rescue StandardError => e` for response control
4. Ensure model has `to_param` returning `slug` if it appears in URLs
5. Read-only actions are covered by Layer 1 automatically

## Error Handling

Every write action MUST use `rescue_and_log` with target/parent context.

- **Layer 1 (automatic)**: `rescue_from StandardError` via `Studio::ErrorHandling` concern (included in `ApplicationController`) and `Api::V1::BaseController`. Logs via `create_error_log(exception)` (no context). `RecordNotFound` → 404, no logging. Re-raises in dev/test.
- **Layer 2 (required for writes)**: `rescue_and_log(target:, parent:)` wraps write actions. Logs via `create_error_log`, attaches target/parent via ActiveRecord setters. Sets `@_error_logged` flag. Pair with outer `rescue StandardError => e`.
- **Central method**: `create_error_log(exception)` → `ErrorLog.capture!(exception)` → returns record for context attachment
- **Auth + error log controllers**: Provided by studio engine. Do not recreate locally.
- API: `RecordNotFound` → 404 (no log), `RecordInvalid` → 422 (logged via `create_error_log`), `StandardError` → 500 (logged)
- HTML NewsController: all write actions (create, update, destroy, archive, reorder, review, process_step, refine, conclude, create_content) wrapped with `target: @news`
- HTML ContentsController: all write actions (create, update, destroy, reorder, hook_step, script_step, assets_step, assemble_step, post_step, review_step) wrapped with `target: @content`
- HTML TasksController: all 8 write actions wrapped with `target: @task`
- HTML SizingsController: `update` wrapped with `target: @task` (nested under tasks at `/tasks/:slug/sizing`)
- API TasksController: all 8 write actions wrapped with `target: task`
- API AgentsController#update, ActivitiesController#create, UsagesController#create: all wrapped
- RankingsController#confirm_draft_pick: wrapped with `target: contract`
- RegistrationsController#create: wrapped with `target: @user`
- ChatController#create: uses `create_error_log(e)` directly (no ActiveRecord target — API-only action)
