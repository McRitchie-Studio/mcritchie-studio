class Release
  # Pure decision logic for the multi-repo `bin/release ship` ("Run Deployment").
  #
  # Like Release::GemfileRepin this is deliberately IO-free: no git, no gem push,
  # no bundle, no network. It takes plans/listings/text in and returns
  # symbols/booleans/arrays out, so the git + gem + bundle orchestration stays in
  # bin/release and ALL the sequencing/version/ordering decisions stay here, unit
  # tested. (bin/release `require`s this file directly — it has no Rails deps.)
  #
  # The four decisions a multi-repo ship turns on:
  #   * which prod-deploy adapter handles a repo            (strategy_handler)
  #   * the hub-before-satellites app order                 (ordered_app_groups)
  #   * which of a consumer's gems still need re-pinning     (gems_to_repin)
  #   * whether a gem version must still be published        (publish_needed?)

    # The ecosystem hub. Release::Ordering already sorts gems before apps, but NOT
    # the hub before the satellites — the hub (SSO/source-of-truth) ships first so
    # a satellite never goes live against a hub that hasn't caught up.
    HUB = "mcritchie-studio"

    # The prod_deploy `strategy` → the bin/release handler that runs it. Raises on
    # an unregistered strategy so a typo in config/release_repos.yml fails loudly
    # at ship time rather than silently skipping a repo's deploy.
    STRATEGY_HANDLERS = {
      "git_push_heroku" => :git_push_heroku,
      "repo_script" => :repo_script
    }.freeze

        raise ArgumentError, "unknown prod_deploy strategy: #{adapter.inspect} (known: #{known})"
      end
    end

    # The app deploy groups with the hub pulled to the front, the rest left in
    # their incoming (producer-first) order. Stable: a non-hub group keeps its
    # relative position. Accepts symbol- OR string-keyed groups (repo_plan returns
    # symbols on the record side; the CLI sees string keys after JSON).

    # The subset of `published_gem_names` whose line in `gemfile_text` still points
    # at a branch/source (so prod must be re-pinned to the published version before
    # it deploys). Composes GemfileRepin so the "what's a source ref" rule lives in
    # exactly one place. Already-pinned gems drop out → an idempotent re-pin pass.

    # Should we publish `version`? No when it is already LIVE on RubyGems (an
    # idempotent skip — the gem made it in a prior run). `remote_versions` is the
    # RubyGems versions listing from /api/v1/versions/<gem>.json: an array of
    # { "number" => ... } entries, all LIVE — RubyGems excludes yanked versions
    # from the listing entirely (there is no `yanked` field). It also accepts a
    # plain array of version strings (the `gem list` shape). A yanked number is
    # simply absent → publish_needed? is true → ship attempts the push → RubyGems
    # rejects re-pushing it → publish_gem aborts. That is the yank safety, and it
    # fails closed at `gem push`, so there is no listing-based yanked? check.
