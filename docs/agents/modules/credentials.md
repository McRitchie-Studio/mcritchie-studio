# Credentials

Credential docs are split into two layers:

- This file defines how agents may access credentials.
- [`credential-inventory.md`](credential-inventory.md) lists known item names and references without exposing secret values.

## Contract

- Never print secrets into the terminal or transcript.
- Use `/opt/homebrew/bin/op` directly for targeted reads.
- Prefer repo scripts that write or consume secrets without echoing them.
- Do not scan vaults broadly unless Mr. McRitchie explicitly asks.
- Do not edit agent tool permissions or `.claude/settings*.json` to gain credential access.
- If a permission is missing, report the exact vault, item, and operation needed instead of inventing a workaround.

## 1Password Service Account

Agent shells use `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` from `~/.zprofile`, installed by:

```bash
cd /Users/alex/projects/mcritchie-studio
bin/setup-1pass-token
```

Verify:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/op whoami
```

Expected user type: `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.

Default access is the `agents` vault. Additional vaults should be granted deliberately for a role or task, such as a DevOps-specific vault for AWS credentials.

## Fresh Machine

On a wiped machine:

1. Clone `mcritchie-studio`.
2. Run `bin/ecosystem-build` until it stops at the 1Password token step.
3. Copy the service account token to the clipboard.
4. Run `bin/setup-1pass-token`.
5. Re-run `bin/ecosystem-build`.

The full recovery path lives in [`../system/house-burn-down.md`](../system/house-burn-down.md).
